SETLyze
=======

The purpose of SETLyze is to provide the people involved with the SETL project
an easy and fast way of getting useful information from the data stored in the
SETL database. The SETL database at GiMaRIS contains data about the settlement
of species in Dutch waters. SETLyze helps provide more insight in a set of
biological questions by performing a set of analyses on this data.
